# Positioning and FLoating Elements

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements)

*In this project, your assignment is to copy [this article from newscientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2286218-ancient-lake-in-marss-gale-crater-may-have-actually-been-a-small-pond/). Use any or all of the positioning techniques you've learned in this section. As usual, ignore any ads, comments or interactive elements (which use JavaScript) and donâ€™t worry about what happens when you change the page width (they use some media queries to rearrange things). Focus on making it look similar.*
